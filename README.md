# DS1631 Library
<img src="https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/DS1631/blob/master/Images/DS1631.png" width="175" align="right"/> *Arduino* library for accessing the [DS1631](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS1631.html), a thermometer with a precision up to 12 bits (0.0625°C) that uses I2C communications. The DS1361A variant differs only in that it starts continuous measurements on power-up or reset while the DS1631 and DS1731 start up in single-shot mode. The DS1631 comes in a small 8-Pin µSOP or SO package and is 3V and 5V tolerant and allows up to 8 devices to be placed on the same I2C bus. The [DS1631 datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1631-DS1731.pdf) describes the chip in detail.

## Description
A detailed description of the library along with further details are available at the GitHub [DS1631 Wiki](https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/DS1631/wiki). This includes wiring information and sample sketches that illustrate the library and it's functionality.
