<img src="https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/DS1361/blob/master/Images/DS1361.png" width="175" align="right"/> The [DS1361 thermometer](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS1631.html) is thermometer with a precision up to 12 bits (0.0625°C) and uses I2C communications. It comes in a small 8-Pin µSOP or SO package and is 3V and 5V tolerant. The [DS1631 datasheet](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS1631-DS1731.pdf) describes the chip in detail.

# DS1631 library

*Arduino* library for accessing the maxim integrated . This clock requires no external components and with an internal temperature-compensated oscillator it is extremely accurate, to within ±5ppm or ±0.432 Second/Day. The library allows setting the date/time and alarms as well as accessing other information on the DS3231M.

## Overview
The DS3231M is available as a SO8 or SO16 package and runs on both 3V and 5V systems. It has two alarms and also battery backup circuitry and requires no external crystals/oscillators or capacitors to run.

## Description
A detailed description of the library along with further details are available at the GitHub [DS1631 Wiki](https://github.com/SV-Zanshin/DS1631/wiki). This includes wiring information and sample sketches that illustrate the library and it's functionality.
